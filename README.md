[**Lookups**](https://github.com/jhays012/Data_Projects/tree/main/Excel/Lookups)
> I utilized [Paris 2024 Olympics medals data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkayalan/paris-2024-olympics-medals/) to demonstrate the VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP Excel functions. I created two tables in the "NATO_Medals" tab:
> 1. nato_total, which uses VLOOKUP to count the total medals earned by each NATO country, and
> 2. nato_gold, which uses XLOOKUP to count the total gold medals earned by each NATO country.
>
> The United States was the top total medal earner as well as the top gold medal earner. There were seven NATO countries that did not earn any medals in the Paris 2024 Olympics: Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. There were eleven NATO countries that did not earn any gold medals in the Paris 2024 Olympics: the previous seven mentioned as well as Albania, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Turkey.

[**Pivot Tables**](https://github.com/jhays012/Data_Projects/tree/main/Excel/Pivot_Tables)
> I utilized [supermarket sales data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales) to demonstrate the use of pivot tables. I created two pivot tables in the "Pivot_Tables" tab:
> 1. quantity sold and net income by product category, and
> 2. quantity sold by product category and customer gender.
>
> The product category most purchased by customers was electronic accessories. However, the highest net income was gained in food/beverages. Female customers most purchased fashion accessory and food/beverage products, while male customers most purchased health/beauty and electronic accessory products.
