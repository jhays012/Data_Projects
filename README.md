[**Lookups**](https://github.com/jhays012/Data_Projects/tree/main/Excel/Lookups)
> I utilized [Paris 2024 Olympics Medals data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkayalan/paris-2024-olympics-medals/) to demonstrate the VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP Excel functions. I created two tables in the "NATO_Medals" tab:
> 1. nato_total, which uses VLOOKUP to count the total medals earned by each NATO country, and
> 2. nato_gold, which uses XLOOKUP to count the total gold medals earned by each NATO country.

> The United States was the top total medal earner as well as the top gold medal earner. There were seven NATO countries that did not earn any medals in the Paris 2024 Olympics: Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. There were eleven NATO countries that did not earn any gold medals in the Paris 2024 Olympics: the previous seven mentioned as well as Albania, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Turkey.
